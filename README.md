# Basic-Survey-Form

This is the beginning of my comeback journey to becoming a developer in 2021.  I'm going to review the basics and build on it  
 
## Motivation

Become more familar with HTML 5 and CSS3.  Build my skills as a developer.  The ultimate goal is to become a developer in 2021.  I will be doing projects from freecodecamp.org and other resources in order to obtain my first developer position.  I build a basic survey form to become more familiar with how a form is created with html and css.
